## PSUSBDIR

This is a tool I wrote for people who want to use USB Mass Storage to interface with PS3 and PS4 consoles. PS4 support isn't complete, and you'll need to edit the source code to use it. PSUSBDIR makes all the folders with their correct name and location wherever you run the program. When you start the program, it will confirm the root location of your new directory, and pressing any key other than ``n`` will make the directory.
